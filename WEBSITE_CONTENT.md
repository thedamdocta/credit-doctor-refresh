## HOW IT WORKS - LEGAL FOUNDATION

### Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) - 1970
- Created by Congress to protect consumers when dealing with credit bureaus
- Limits who can see a consumer's credit report
- Mandates how long negative information can remain on a report
- Contains identity theft protections
- Credit bureaus must follow "reasonable procedures" to ensure "maximum possible accuracy"

### Consumer Rights Under FCRA
- **Right to dispute errors** in credit report
- **30-day investigation requirement** by credit bureaus
- **Reinvestigation process** must include reviewing all relevant information
- **Furnisher responsibilities** - must investigate and report results
- **Free credit report** if dispute results in changes
- **Written notice** with furnisher contact information

### Legal Process
1. Consumer sends dispute to credit bureau
2. Bureau investigates within 30 days
3. Bureau notifies furnisher within 5 days
4. Furnisher investigates and reports back
5. If inaccurate, furnisher must notify all three bureaus
6. Consumer receives written results and free report if changes made

   - Longer established history raises score
   - Age of oldest account, newest account, average age
   
4. **10% New Credit**
   - Opening several accounts quickly increases risk

## FAQ HIGHLIGHTS

### Credit Score Questions
**Q: Will I be penalized for shopping around for the best interest rate?**
A: Credit scores count every consumer-initiated application, but many models recognize shopping and either ignore inquiries within a time period or count multiple inquiries for the same purpose as one.

**Q: Can I use a credit score as leverage for a lower interest rate?**
A: Yes, you have more leverage if your score puts you in the low-risk range, though different lenders may use different scoring models.

**Q: Do pre-approved offers affect credit score?**
A: No, only applications for credit initiated by the consumer affect your score.

**Q: Does having too many credit cards affect score?**
A: Having too many cards with high balances or large amounts of available credit can negatively impact scores.

**Q: Do late payments affect credit score?**
A: Yes, paying bills on time is generally the single most important contributor to a good credit score. Late payments remain on report for up to seven years.

**Q: Do inquiries affect credit score?**
A: Yes, but they have relatively small impact. They only become significant with other issues like late payments or high debt.
