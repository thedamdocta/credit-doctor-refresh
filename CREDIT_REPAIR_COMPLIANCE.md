# Credit Repair Marketing & Compliance Guide (CROA)

## Introduction

This document outlines the key legal and compliance requirements for marketing and operating a credit repair business, based on the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA). Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory to protect consumers and avoid legal penalties.

## 1. Prohibited Practices

Under the CROA, it is illegal to:

*   **Make Untrue or Misleading Statements:** You cannot make any statement that is untrue or misleading regarding a consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity to any consumer reporting agency or creditor. This includes any statement that you should reasonably know to be false.
*   **Alter Consumer's Identification:** You cannot advise a consumer to alter their identity to prevent the display of their credit record.
*   **Misrepresent Services:** You cannot make any untrue or misleading representations about the services you offer.
*   **Engage in Fraud or Deception:** You cannot engage in any act that constitutes fraud or deception in connection with the offer or sale of your services.

**Key Takeaway:** All marketing claims must be truthful, accurate, and substantiated. Avoid making promises that cannot be guaranteed.

## 2. Payment in Advance

**You cannot charge or receive any payment for your services before those services are fully performed.**

This is a critical provision of the CROA. The "100% Warranty" and "or you don't pay" language in our proposed "Grand Slam Offer" aligns with this, but we must ensure our billing practices are fully compliant.

## 3. Required Disclosures

Before a consumer signs any contract, you must provide them with a separate written statement titled **"Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law."** This document must include the following information:

*   The consumer's right to dispute inaccurate information directly with the credit bureau.
*   The fact that accurate, current, and verifiable information cannot be removed.
*   The consumer's right to a free copy of their credit report under certain circumstances.
*   The consumer's right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the CROA.
*   The consumer's right to cancel their contract within 3 business days.
*   The role of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in regulating credit repair organizations.

A copy of this statement, signed by the consumer, must be kept on file for 2 years.

## 4. Contract Requirements

All contracts for credit repair services must be in writing and include:

*   **Terms of Payment:** The total amount of all payments to be made.
*   **Description of Services:** A full and detailed description of the services to be performed, including all guarantees and an estimated timeline for completion.
*   **Business Information:** Your name and principal business address.
*   **Right to Cancel:** A conspicuous, bold-face statement near the signature line informing the consumer of their right to cancel the contract within 3 business days.

## 5. Right to Cancel

Consumers have the right to cancel their contract, without penalty or obligation, at any time before midnight of the third business day after signing. Each contract must be accompanied by a "Notice of Cancellation" form that the consumer can use for this purpose.

## Conclusion

Compliance with the CROA is not optional. All marketing materials, sales processes, and business operations must be designed to meet these legal requirements. This includes:

*   **Reviewing all marketing copy** to ensure it is truthful and not misleading.
*   **Structuring our billing** to ensure we are not charging for services in advance.
*   **Creating and providing the required disclosure documents** to all potential clients.
*   **Ensuring all contracts** meet the requirements of the CROA.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can build a sustainable and ethical business that genuinely helps consumers while protecting ourselves from legal risk.
